## Data Format
The format of the data is important in order to properly use the treemap layout. There are 3 variables you can change when using this software: grouping, measure, and selectedDisplay.

### grouping
Grouping is the variable that will cluster or categorize your data by color. The data types should be strings that identify different types of categories.

### measure
Measure is the numerical unit that will determine the size of the square in each grouping. The data types should be integers that reflect some sort of total or numerical representation.


### selectedDisplay
selectedDisplay is the variable that will display the text for each square, identifying the subject being displayed.
